# Note Web Interface

A modern web interface for browsing and managing AI-powered notes generated by the note-cli tool.

## Overview

This Next.js application provides a visual interface to interact with your notes, transcriptions, and recordings created through the command-line tool. It connects directly to your local SQLite database and file system to provide a seamless browsing experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- A configured note-cli setup with existing notes
- Access to `~/.noteai/` directory

### Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application.

## Features (Planned)

### Core Functionality
- **Note Browser**: Browse all imported notes with search and filtering
- **Audio Playback**: Listen to original recordings with synchronized transcripts
- **Content Viewer**: Rich display of transcriptions, summaries, and metadata
- **Search Interface**: Full-text search across all note content

### Advanced Features
- **Interactive Timeline**: Visualize notes chronologically
- **Content Analysis**: Statistics and insights from your note collection
- **Export Tools**: Export notes to various formats (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
- **Tagging System**: Organize notes with custom tags and categories

### User Experience
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices
- **Dark/Light Theme**: Toggle between viewing modes
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Efficient navigation with shortcuts
- **Real-time Updates**: Automatically refresh when CLI adds new notes

## Technical Architecture

### Data Integration
- Direct SQLite database access (`~/.noteai/notes.db`)
- File system integration for audio and markdown files
- Real-time synchronization with CLI operations

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15.3.4 with App Router
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Database**: SQLite (via better-sqlite3)
- **Audio**: HTML5 Audio API with custom controls

### API Routes
- `/api/notes` - Note listing and search
- `/api/notes/[id]` - Individual note details
- `/api/audio/[id]` - Audio file streaming
- `/api/stats` - Collection statistics

## Development Status

**Current Phase**: Initial setup and planning

**Next Steps**:
1. Database connection and schema mapping
2. Basic note listing and detail views
3. Audio playback integration
4. Search functionality implementation
5. UI/UX design and styling

## Integration with CLI

The web interface is designed to complement the note-cli tool:
- **Read-only access** to CLI-generated data
- **Synchronized views** of the same note collection
- **Enhanced browsing** capabilities beyond CLI limitations
- **Visual insights** into your note-taking patterns

## Scripts

```bash
# Development with Turbopack
npm run dev

# Production build
npm run build
npm start

# Code quality
npm run lint
```

## Configuration

The application automatically detects your note-cli configuration:
- Reads from `~/.noteai/config.json`
- Accesses notes database at `~/.noteai/notes.db`
- Serves audio files from `~/.noteai/recordings/`
- Displays markdown files from `~/.noteai/notes/`
